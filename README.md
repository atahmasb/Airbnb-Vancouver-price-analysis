# Airbnb-Vancouver-price-analysis

This project explores Airbnb data for Vancouver and it aims at answering this main question:
"What factors determine a price of Airbnb listings?"

I present a Machine Learning model to model the price of Airbnb listings. Analysing the model's results reveals the important features that determine the price. 

A less technical article with more in-depth analysis of the project results can be found on Medium:
